Repo is a bit messy at the moment. I am working on fixing the issues.

On a different project I encountered an issue where users would submit html copies of what I think to be their website page to act as a description for their post. I needed a way to format the HTML text to a simple text version so people could read it with ease. 
I combined a few tutorials I found and wrote a method that I can call to format the HTML text.
